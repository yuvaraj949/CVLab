The hardest task was detecting and labeling all people in crowded scenes, due to overlap and diversity in appearance. 
Machine learning models could automate this by learning patterns from large datasets and applying them rapidly. 
Manual analysis gave me insight into the complexity and variability present in real-world scenes, 
highlighting the importance of robust algorithms.
